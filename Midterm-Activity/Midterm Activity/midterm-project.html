            <strong>Luzon</strong> <i>(/luːˈzɒn/;</i> <small>Tagalog pronunciation:</small> [luˈson]) is the largest and most populous island in the <span>Philippines</span>. Located in the northern portion of the Philippines archipelago, it is the economic and political center of the nation, being home to the country's capital city, <span>Manila </span>, as well as <span>Quezon City</span>, the country's most populous city. With a population of 64 million as of 2021,<sup>[3]</sup> it contains 52.5% of the country's total population and is the fourth most populous island in the world.<sup>[4]</sup>  It is the 15th largest island in the world by land area.
           <br>
           <br> 
             Luzon may also refer to one of the three primary island groups in the country. In this usage, it includes the Luzon mainland, the <span>Batanes</span> and Babuyan groups of islands to the north, Polillo Islands to the east, and the outlying islands of <span>Catanduanes, Marinduque and Mindoro</span>, among others, to the south.<sup>[5]</sup> The islands of <span>Masbate, Palawan and Romblon</span> are also included, although these three are sometimes grouped with another of the island groups, the <strong>Visayas</strong>.

          <h1>Etymology</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>
            The name Luzon is thought to derive from <i>lusong</i>, a Tagalog word referring to a particular kind of large wooden mortar used in dehusking rice.<sup>[6][7]</sup> A 2008 research paper by <span>Eulito Bautista</span> and <span>Evelyn Javier</span> provides an image of a lusong, explaining:
            Traditional milling was accomplished in the 1900s by pounding the palay with a wooden pestle in a stone or wooden mortar called lusong. The first pounding takes off the hull and further pounding removes the bran but also breaks most grains. Further winnowing with a bamboo tray (bilao) separates the hull from the rice grains. This traditional hand-pounding chore, although very laborious and resulted in a lot of broken rice, required two to three skilled men and women to work harmoniously and was actually a form of socializing among young folks in the villages.<sup>[8]</sup>
            In old Latin, Italian, and Portuguese maps, the island is often called "Luçonia" or "Luconia."<sup>[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]</sup><br>
            <br>
            Luções, [luˈsõjʃ] (also <i>Luzones</i> in Spanish) was a demonym<sup>[17]</sup> used by Portuguese sailors in <span>Malaysia</span><sup>[18]</sup> during the early 1500s, referring to the Kapampangan and Tagalog people who lived in Manila Bay, which was then called <i>Lusong </i>(Portuguese: Luçon), from which Luzon was also derived.<sup>[19][20][21][18]</sup> The term was also used for Tagalog settlers in Southern Tagalog region. Eventually, the term <span>"Luzones"</span> would refer to the settlers of Luzon island, and later on, would be exclusive to the peoples of Central Luzon.
